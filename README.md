# WynnLibFabric
WynnLib is a Fabric mod that aims to provide data-related functionalities for the server Wynncraft.
The mod inherits from the mod WynnInvManager (WIM), 
but comes up with a better framework design and supports newer Minecraft versions. 
As an open-source project, the contribution is welcome. 

Feel free to use the mod as a data library of your own mod. 

Planned Improvements: 
- Handbook UI rework
- Data structure rework

Planned New Features: 
- Translatable language support
- New Wynncraft 2.0 content support (e.g. ability tree)
